# Fort-Ontario-AR
HCI Project 2, AR app for Fort Ontario
Created in Android Studio for HCI Project 2 - AR app that overlays on top of recognized images.

The included images in assets are not necessary, they are only there so if people choose to compile it, they have something to scan.
I would recommend removing them from assets before hand otherwise the APK will be a lot larger than it needs to be.

This simply would not exist without the above collection of tutorials.
